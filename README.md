# AT&T Spam Detector 🕵️‍♀️

## Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT\&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals 🎯
Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

## Data

There is 1 file in the src folder:
- spam.csv : spams dataset
